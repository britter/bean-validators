Since the 0.7.0 release this project also publishes a https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_testing.html#sec:java_test_fixtures[test fixtures variant].
The test fixtures variant provides functionality which is useful for testing custom validators.
Please refer to the link:apidocs/test-fixtures/index.html[Test Fixtures JavaDoc] for more information on how to use.

To use the test fixtures in your tests add them to your Gradle build:

.build.gradle.kts
[source,java,subs="attributes+"]
----
dependencies {
    tesImplementation(testFixtures("{gradle-project-group}:{gradle-project-name}:{gradle-project-version}"))
}
----

If you use Maven you can add them by adding the corresponding classifer:

.pom.xml
[source,xml,subs="attributes+"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>{gradle-project-group}</groupId>
    <artifactId>{gradle-project-name}</artifactId>
    <version>{gradle-project-version}</version>
    <classifier>test-fixtures</classifier>
</dependency>
----
