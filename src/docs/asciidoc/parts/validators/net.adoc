Constraints dealing with networking.

## @Domain

Makes sure a string represents a valid domain. Note that the list of valid top level domains is changes frequently. Since
this validator uses `org.apache.commons.validator.routines.DomainValidator` under the hood, there may be domains which
are acutally valid reported as invalid, because the Apache Commons Validator TLP list is not up to date.

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * valid:
     *      "www.example.com"
     *
     * invalid:
     *      "https://www.example.com"
     *      "abcd"
     */
    @Domain
    private String domain;
----

## @IP

Makes sure a String represents a valid [Internet Protocol (IP) address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address). There
are two kinds of IP addresses: IPv4 and the newer IPv6. The default is to validate against both versions. The behavior
can be controlled by the `com.github.britter.beanvalidators.net.IPType` enum.

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * valid:
     *      "192.168.0.1"
     *      "fe80::8a1f:a1ff:fe11:9326"
     *
     * invalid:
     *      "abcd"
     *      "999.168.0.1"
     *      "ge80::8a1f:a1ff:fe11:9326"
     */
    @IP
    private String ip;

    /**
     * valid:
     *      "192.168.0.1"
     *
     * invalid:
     *      "abcd"
     *      "fe80::8a1f:a1ff:fe11:9326"
     *      "999.168.0.1"
     *      "ge80::8a1f:a1ff:fe11:9326"
     */
    @IP(type = IPType.IP_V4)
    private String ipv4;

    /**
     * valid:
     *      "fe80::8a1f:a1ff:fe11:9326"
     *
     * invalid:
     *      "abcd"
     *      "192.168.0.1"
     *      "999.168.0.1"
     *      "ge80::8a1f:a1ff:fe11:9326"
     */
    @IP(type = IPType.IP_V6)
    private String ipv6;
----

## @Port

Makes sure a String, int or Integer represents a valid [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking))
number. A port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer, thus ranging from 0 to 65535. `@Port` can be applied to String, ints
and Integers. If `@Port` is applied to any other type, a ValidationException will be thrown.

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * valid:
     *      "8080"
     *
     * invalid:
     *      "-8080"
     *      "65537"
     *      "abcd"
     */
    @Port
    private String portString;

    /**
     * valid:
     *      8080
     *
     * invalid:
     *      -8080
     *      65537
     */
    @Port
    private int portInt;

    /**
     * valid:
     *      Integer.valueOf(8080)
     *
     * invalid:
     *      Integer.valueOf(-8080)
     *      Integer.valueOf(65537)
     */
    @Port
    private Integer portInteger;
