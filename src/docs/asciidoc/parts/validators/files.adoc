Constraints validating all properties of `java.io.File` objects. There is an annotation for each property as well as one
for the negation of each property. All annotations can also be applied to Strings. The validators will construct a new
File instance using `new File(String)` and use that instance for validation.

## @Absolute

Makes sure a file represents an absolute path in the file system.

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * valid:
     *      file.isAbsolute() == true
     *
     * invalid:
     *      dir.isAbsolute() == false
     */
    @Absolute
    private File file;
----

## @NotAbsolute

Makes sure a file does not represent an absolute path in the file system.

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * valid:
     *      file.isAbsolute() == false
     *
     * invalid:
     *      dir.isAbsolute() == true
     */
    @NotAbsolute
    private File file;
----

## @Directory

Makes sure a file represents a directory.

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * valid:
     *      dir.isDirectory() == true
     *
     * invalid:
     *      dir.isDirectory() == false
     */
    @Directory
    private File dir;
----

## @NotDirectory

Makes sure a file does not represent a directory.

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * valid:
     *      dir.isDirectory() == false
     *
     * invalid:
     *      dir.isDirectory() == true
     */
    @NotDirectory
    private File dir;
----

## @Executable

Makes sure a file has executable permission in the file system.

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * valid:
     *      file.canExecute() == true
     *
     * invalid:
     *      file.canExecute() == false
     */
    @Executable
    private File file;
----

## @NotExecutable

Makes sure a file does not have executable permission in the file system.

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * valid:
     *      file.canExecute() == false
     *
     * invalid:
     *      file.canExecute() == true
     */
    @NotExecutable
    private File file;
----

## @Existing

Makes sure a file exists.

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * valid:
     *      file.exists() == true
     *
     * invalid:
     *      file.exists() == false
     */
    @Existing
    private File file;
----

## @NotExisting

Makes sure a file does not exist.

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * valid:
     *      file.exists() == false
     *
     * invalid:
     *      file.exists() == true
     */
    @NotExisting
    private File file;
----

## @File

Makes sure a file represents a file in the file system.

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * valid:
     *      file.isFile() == true
     *
     * invalid:
     *      file.isFile() == false
     */
    @com.github.britter.beanvalidators.file.IsFile
    private File file;
----

## @NotFile

Makes sure a file does not represent a file in the file system. Note that both `File.isFile()` and `File.isDirectory()`
can return false, for example for sockets, mounts or pipes.

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * valid:
     *      file.isFile() == false
     *
     * invalid:
     *      file.isFile() == true
     */
    @NotFile
    private File file;
----

## @Hidden

Makes sure a file is hidden. Note that the definition of a hidden files various between operating systems. For examples
in an UNIX-like OS, all files and directories starting with a dot are considered to be hidden, where as on Windows the
hidden attribute of the file has to be set to true.

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * valid:
     *      file.isHidden() == true
     *
     * invalid:
     *      file.isHidden() == false
     */
    @Hidden
    private File file;
----

## @NotHidden

Makes sure a file is not hidden.

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * valid:
     *      file.isHidden() == false
     *
     * invalid:
     *      file.isHidden() == true
     */
    @NotHidden
    private File file;
----

## @Readable

Makes sure a file is readable.

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * valid:
     *      file.canRead() == true
     *
     * invalid:
     *      file.canRead() == false
     */
    @Readable
    private File file;
----

## @NotReadable

Makes sure a file is not readable. There is probably no real use case for this annotation, but it has been added for completeness

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * valid:
     *      file.canRead() == false
     *
     * invalid:
     *      file.canRead() == true
     */
    @NotReadable
    private File file;
----

## @Writable

Makes sure a file is writable.

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * valid:
     *      file.canWrite() == true
     *
     * invalid:
     *      file.canWrite() == false
     */
    @Writable
    private File file;
----

## @NotWritable

Makes sure a file is not writeable.

[source,java]
----
    /**
     * valid:
     *      file.canWrite() == false
     *
     * invalid:
     *      file.canWrite() == true
     */
    @NotWritable
    private File file;
